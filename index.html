            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.</p>

                Evaluations of the effectiveness of international support to the sector are rare.[114] Addressing
                regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of
                understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and
                accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes
                for the poor.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational
                settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social
                psychology of schools as organizations. The terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are
                often used interchangeably. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational
                attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as gifted children and those with
                specific disabilities.</p>
